## comparison operators
The comparison operators are used to compare two values.


| Operator | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| == | equal to |
| != | not equal to |
| > | greater than |
| < | less than |
| >= | greater than or equal to |
| <= | less than or equal to |

## if
Imagine that you are a programmer and you have to write a program that will tell if the value of a variable is positive
```rust
let x = 5;
```
For that, you will have to check if `x` is superior to 0.
We can do that with the `if` statement.

```rust
if x > 0 {
    println!("x is positive");
}
```
The code between the `{}` will be executed because the condition `x > 0` is true.
If we change the value of `x` to a negative number, the code between the `{}` will not be executed.
## else 
Imagine that you are a programmer and you have to write a program that will say hello if the value of a variable is equal to 5, and goodbye if it is not.

To do that, you will first have to check if `x` is equal to 5, and then use the else statement to say goodbye if the condition is not true.
```rust
if x == 5 {
    println!("Hello");
} else {
    println!("Goodbye");
}
```

Let's run the code with `x = 5`:
```
Hello
```
And with `x = 6`:
```
Goodbye
```
## else if
It is possible to have more than one condition to be checked.
Imagine that we want to say hello if `x` is equal to 5, good morning if it is equal to 6, and good night if either of the two conditions is not true.

we can do that with the `else if` statement.
```rust
if x == 5 {
    println!("Hello");
} else if x == 6 {
    println!("Good morning");
} else {
    println!("Good night");
}
```

lets run the code with `x = 5`:
```
Hello
```
And with `x = 6`:
```
Good morning
```
And with `x = 7`:
```
Good night
```
> ‚ÑπÔ∏è We can put as many `else if` as we want. The condition of the `else if` will be checked after the condition of the previous `else if`.
