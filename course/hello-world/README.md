# Hello worldüëã
## Declaring a function
We will start this course by creating an hello world program with the rust ü¶Ä programming language.

We will start by creating a new folder `üìÇ hello-world` and a file `üìÑ main.rs` inside it.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è `.rs` is the extension for rust files.

We can now open the file `üìÑ main.rs` in our IDE, as well as a terminal of your choice, and start writing our program.

We declare a function called `main` because all rust programs begin with a function `main`.

```rust
// üìÑ main.rs
fn main() {

}
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è the `fn` keyword is used to declare a function.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è the lines starting with `//` are comments, they are ignored when executing the program.

## Printing a messageüí¨

In the function, we will call the `println!` macro to print a message to the console. And we pass the string `Hello, world!` as an argument.

```rust
// üìÑ main.rs
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è All instructions end with a semicolon `;`
## Compiling and running a programüèÉ
Now that we have coded our program, we will compile it and run it.

to compile the program, we can use the `rustc` command.

```bash
$ rustc main.rs
```
> ‚ÑπÔ∏è `$` : command

Running this command created an executable file called `üìÑ main` in the current directory that we can run by typing `./main`.

```bash
$ ./main
> Hello, world!
```
> ‚ÑπÔ∏è `>` : Output of the command
