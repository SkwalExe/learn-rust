# For loopsüî¢
## What is a for loop‚ùì
For loops are used to iterate over a given sequence.

## The for keywordüîë
The `for` keyword is used to create a for loop.

Example:

```rust
for count in 0..5 {
    println!("üî¢ -> {}", count);
}
```
Here, `count` is the variable that holds the current value of the loop, and `0..5` is an expression that generates the range of values to iterate over. 

`0..5` is the range of values from 0 to 5 (5 not included).

Output:
```
üî¢ -> 0
üî¢ -> 1
üî¢ -> 2
üî¢ -> 3
üî¢ -> 4
```

**It is possible to store a range in a variable:**
```rust
let range = 0..5;
for count in range {
    println!("üì¢ {}", count);
}
```
Output:
```
üì¢ 0
üì¢ 1
üì¢ 2
üì¢ 3
üì¢ 4
```
## Vector iteration
### What is a vector‚ùì
A vector is a group of values that can be iterated over.
### Declaring a vector
A vector can be declared with the `vec!` macro and the values separated by commas.
Example:
```rust
let animals = vec!["üêí Monkey", "üêï Dog", "ü¶Ñ Unicorn"];
```
### Iterating over a vector
A vector can be iterated over using the `for` loop.

Example:
```rust
let animals = vec!["üêí Monkey", "üêï Dog", "ü¶Ñ Unicorn"];

for animal in animals.iter() {
    println!("My üí´ favorite animal üí´ is the {}", animal);
}
```
Output:
```
My üí´ favorite animal üí´ is the üêí Monkey
My üí´ favorite animal üí´ is the üêï Dog
My üí´ favorite animal üí´ is the ü¶Ñ Unicorn
```
> ‚ÑπÔ∏è We use the `iter()` method to get an iterator over the vector and to prevent the ownership of the vector from being moved and being able to use it after the loop 

### Iterating over a vector with indexüî¢
It is possible to iterate over a vector knowing the index of the current element.

We can do that with the `enumerate()` method.

Example:

```rust
let fruits = vec!["üçá Grapes", "üçà Melons", "üçå Bananas"];

for (index, fruit) in fruits.iter().enumerate() {
    println!("I love {} at index {}", fruit, index);
}
```
Output:
```
I love üçá Grapes at index 0 
I love üçà Melons at index 1
I love üçå Bananas at index 2
```
> ‚ÑπÔ∏è We use `(index, number)` because the `enumerate()` method returns a tuple with the index and the value.
